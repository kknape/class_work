    /*
      -The queryURL which points to the JSON
      -The GET method which tells JavaScript to download the JSON
      -The then function which tells JavaScript to run the code inside ONLY when done with the     download
      -Most importantly that all of the data is being stored in the response object
      -Lastly, in your Chrome inspector, all the code past line 26 happens before the results of   our API call are logged. Even though that happens first lexically.
