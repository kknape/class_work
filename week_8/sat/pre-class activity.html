<!--Without running the code, determine what the following code will output and why:
NaN

var a = 1;

function outer(){
    var a = 2;
                function inner(){
                                    //in essence it's adding var a; here but w/o value...so adding 1 results in NaN
                    a++;
                        console.log(a);
                    var a = 5; //var a in this spot, gets pulled into the inner function the "=5" doesn't get read until this line
                }                  //always declare your variables at the beginning of your function
    inner();
}
outer();
